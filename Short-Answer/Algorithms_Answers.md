#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n) - There is only one operation happening, which indicates this will run n amount of times.

b) Logarithmic O(log n) or Polynomial O(n^c) - Nested loops that increment and multiply so as it iterates the inputs become larger.

c) Linear O(n) - loops and performs one operation based on the input of n

## Exercise II

O(log n) - I would use a binary search to minimize the the number of dropped and broken eggs by finding the midpoint of the n-story building. I would then go to midpoint drop an egg if it did not break I then just eliminated the lower half of the n-story building. In which case I would find the midpoint between the floor I just dropped the egg from and the top of the n-story building. Repeating this until the egg breaks and I find the f floor.
