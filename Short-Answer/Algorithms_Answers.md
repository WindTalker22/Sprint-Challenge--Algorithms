#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n) - There is only one operation happening, which indicates this will run n amount of times.

b) Logarithmic O(log n) or Polynomial O(n^c) - Nested loops that increment and multiply so as it iterates the inputs become larger.

c) Linear O(n) - loops and performs one operation based on the input of n

## Exercise II
